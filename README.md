# blog
This is my blog project, created with the help of CodeIgniter for MVC structuring.

## Hosting
Unfortunately, I am as of now unable to host this blog on GitHub Pages for 
unknown reasons (perhaps compatibility issues with CodeIgniter projects?)

## Languages
This project was made with the use of Bootstrap, JQuery, MySQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Contributions
Huge thanks to my mentor Adnane Chaabi, cofounder of Spotfields, who helped me create and
develop this blog during my time as an intern there.

Working on this project drastically improved my knowledge of backend development (from 0 too 100 real quick)
, as well as frameworks like Bootstrap.
